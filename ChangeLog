      stick_fixed_radius determines whether they are inscribed or not

    * Torsional term added to sculpting engine...not perfect, but it's                      
      probably better than allowing for eclipsed conformations all over the place.          
                                                                                            
    * Optimized sculpting engine using CHUD/Shark -- now much faster.                       
                                                                                            
    * Fixed CENT action with multi-state object                                             
                                                                                            
    * Adjusting Z scaling for mouse to provide finer control                                
                                                                                            
    * Better WYSIWYG: If they are set to zero, then the settings:                           
        mesh_radius, line_radius, ribbon_radius,  dot_radius, dash_radius                   
      are now subordinated to:                                                              
        mesh_width, line_width, ribbon_width, dot_width, and dash_width.                    
      However, if changed to a non-zero value, they will take priority.                     
                                                                                            
      This behavior provides better WYSIWYG for raytracing, but will break                  
      some scripts.                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * fixed map_new ...,gaussian,... command and added options                              
          gaussian_resolution

       default "map_new name" now creates a 2 A electron density map using                  
       current atomic Q and B for direct comparison with experimental density               
                                                                                            
    * updated ray tracer to support edge oversampling -- Antialiased rendering              
      is now SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER for simple scenes and is now enabled by                   
      default. Full scene supersampling is no longer necessary in most cases, but           
      if activated, it will provide even better image quality.                              
                                                                                            
      Antialias setting can now have values of 0-4:                                         
        antialias 0: no antialiasing                                                        
        antialias 1: edge-oversampling (as per ray_oversample_cutoff)                       
        antialias 2: 2X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
        antialias 3: 3X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
        antialias 4: 4X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
                                                                                            
    * restored CRLFs on Windows versions of PyMOL so that                                   
      python code can be viewed/edited with Notepad, etc.

    * fixed endianness problems with map files

    * ray_shadows setting can disable shadows in raytracer (slight performance inc.)        
                                                                                            
    * added secondary structure to chemical python model data structure                     
                                                                                            
    * fixed slab mode of clip statement                                                     
                                                                                            
    * update 'expand' and 'attach' can now take an atom name as well as an element symbol   
                                                                                            
 Changes up to 0.85                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * mmatrix now stores the complete view instead of just the rotation matrix              
                                                                                            
    * unset command                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * fixed handling of calcium atoms                                                       
                                                                                            
    * added automatic scroll bar for when you get too many objects/selections               
                                                                                            
    * added handle to manually adjust internal gui width                                    
                                                                                            
    * updated OpenGL depth_cue setting to more closely match those of raytracer             
                                                                                            
    * "center" command                                                                      
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL no longer wraps output lines by default "set wrap_output=78"                    
      to get previous behavior                                                              
                                                                                            
    * relocated binary shared objects from modules into the modules/pymol                   
      tree                                                                                  
                                                                                            
    * data files now separated from the modules directory into a parallel data              
      tree in $PYMOL_PATH                                                                   
                                                                                            
    * added ability to build PyMOL using Python distutils                                   
                                                                                            
    * revamped the PyMOL launch process.  It should now be possible                         
      to launch pymol simply with an "import pymol" statement, provided                     
      that the modules are in the Python search path                                        
                                                                                            
    * fixed get_dihedral to use current state index                                         
                                                                                            
    * revamped smooth command and added documentation                                       
                                                                                            
    * added some nasty code to handle quotes and apostrophes in atom selections             
      so that nucleic acids and sugars with apostrophes will work right while               
      you can also still explicitly use apostrophes or quotes                               
                                                                                            
    * added "safe" option to zoom command in order to provide a mode                        
      which will guarantee against clipping                                                 
                                                                                            
 Changes up to 0.84                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * updated SPHEROID command for use with trajectories                                    
                                                                                            
    * Can now read AMBER topology, coordinate, trajectory, and restart files                
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL now transforms 4-character atom names appropriately by default.                 
      Thus, 3HG2 in PDB file becomes an atom named "HG23"                                   
      If you don't like this, "set pdb_literal_names=1".                                    
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL now preserves stereo field on MOL-files to better enable                        
      shuttling of 2D structures through PyMOL...                                           
                                                                                            
    * fixed bug with dumping of dot surfaces...                                             
                                                                                            
    * fixed bug reading element identifer from PDB files                                    
                                                                                            
    * fixed bug with alternate conformations

    * various tweaks to the semistatic minimal dependencies build...                        
                                                                                            
    * fixed bug in startup file reading                                                     
                                                                                            
    * first inclusion of cex file support

    * WARNING: default behavior of isomesh and isosurf changed!  By default, they           
      will now always load the mesh into state 1.  If you need the previous behavior,       
      then set the state argument to zero.

    * modified "cmd.system" to take an argument for asynchronous execution                  
                                                                                            
    * flag command no longer indicates atoms by default -- set "auto_indicate_flags"        
                                                                                            
    * cross-eye side-by-side stereo support                                                 
                                                                                            
    * fixed bug in valency display code                                                     
                                                                                            
    * fixed major bug in "create"                                                           
                                                                                            
    * raytracing bugfix for bond with zero length                                           
                                                                                            
    * complicated workaround for mouse atom selections with Radeon 8500 and WinXP           
      PyMOL may now be somewhat resistant to broken OpenGL ReadPixels implementations       
                                                                                            
    * improved water handling for "non-canonical" situations (i.e. real life muck)          
                                                                                            
    * moved configuration files to a subdirectory "setup"                                   
                                                                                            
    * mpng now can support a range in order to enable coarse-grained parallelism            
      (distributed movie rendering)                                                         
                                                                                            
    * "within" operator added to selection language

    * fixed triangle rendering on lower-end graphics cards                                  
                                                                                            
    * revamped PyMOL's internal bond handling data structure.  I've done my best            
      to insure that this doesn't break anything, but it is a major change                  
      and has the potential to create huge problems...

    * HETATMS are no longer surfaced by default.  Clear the "ignore" flag or                
      set surface_mode=1 to restore their surfaces.

      flags                                                                                 
                                                                                            
    * established some standard flag names and conventions                                  
                                                                                            
    * Upgrading OpenGL Pop-up menus, since it looks like the internal GUI                   
      will be widely used despite its original limited role (oh well...)

    * added ray_improve_shadows setting for improving shadows by                            
      projecting outward from triangles.                                                    
                                                                                            
    * Fixed a major bug in the raytracer which was causing bogus shadows to appear          
      on surfaces                                                                           
                                                                                            
    * Fixed a huge bug in surfacing of subsets. That function was totally whacked,          
      but no one had noticed or complained!!!  Revised the function of the                  
      surface_proximity setting                                                             
                                                                                            
    *  by default, PDB HETATMs are no longer surfaced -- if you want them to be, then       
       please "set surface_mode=1"                                                          
                                                                                            
    * "transparent" renamed to "transparency"                                               
                                                                                            
    * switched to a three-pass OpenGL rendering model in order to properly display opaque,  
      transparent, and antialiased objects                                                  
                                                                                            
    * OpenGL transparency now works too! See "help transparency".                           
                                                                                            
    * nonbonded spheres are now pickable                                                    
                                                                                            
    * surface_color and mesh_color override the default atom colors                         
      for uniform surface coloring -- added support for color names                         
      into the settings module                                                              
                                                                                            
    * flags 24 and 25 now work with surfaces and meshes.  See "help flags"

    * Transparency support in rendering has been added, but it doesn't yet                  
      exist yet in opengl mode.

    * stage 1 API enhancements -- consistent return conventions adopted                     
      (many will not follow conventions until stage 2 though)                               
                                                                                            
    * more surface_qualities: -3 to 2, surface_quality=1 is now even better                 
                                                                                            
    * click-and-drag a box to select atoms

    * LOG FILE CAPABILITIES:  logging of both PyMOL scripts (.pml) and                      
      PyMOL program files (.pym). The "resume" command allows propagation                   
      of session-like behavior.  This makes a huge difference in PyMOL                      
      user-friendliness.

    pymol language on the fly.

    * Parser improved with a new argument parsing subsystem which has a                     
    better mapping to standard Python arguments.  This has significant                      
    potential to break existing code if there are any bugs, but I am                        
    shooting for 100% backwards compatibility.

         integration of basic force-field structures into PyMOL...not a                     
         lightweight task, but something I think should be done in a                        
         general way to facilitate use of PyMOL as a molecular modeling                     
         tool...

       * fold MMTK into the main PyMOL distribution, and merge the two                      
         programs in a way which allow the user to "see" into MMTK's                        
         internal data structures using PyMOL while calculations are                        
         being performed.
