===========================
PyMOL environment variables
===========================

PyMOL is designed to run under two types of environments.  They are:

(1) Single-directory self-contained install. (Windows, Mac, Unix Standalone)

(2) Package-managed with files spread all over the OS. (RedHat, Debian)

Environment (1)
---------------

Environment variable PYMOL_PATH serves as the root directory
and tells PyMOL where to find everything, including its code.

Required: PYMOL_PATH

Environment (2)
---------------

PyMOL code is installed in the system Python namespace, so no explicit
environment variable is required to access it.  The root python
modules defined in site-packages are "pymol", "pmg_tk", and "chempy".

Required: PYMOL_DATA, PYMOL_SCRIPTS

PYMOL_DATA is usually /usr/share/pymol/data
PYMOL_SCRIPTS is usually /usr/share/pymol/scripts

Mechanism
---------

PYMOL_DATA and PYMOL_SCRIPTS dominate if provided.  Otherwise, if
PYMOL_PATH is defined, PYMOL_DATA becomes $PYMOL_PATH/data, and
PYMOL_SCRIPTS becomes $PYMOL_PATH/scripts. 

if $PYMOL_PATH is defined and $PYMOL_PATH/modules exists, then
$PYMOL_PATH/modules is added to the Python module search path.

Under MacOS X, PYMOL_PATH is self-defining.  Under Windows, this
environment variable is stored in the registry during installation.
Under Unix, PYMOL_PATH needs to be defined prior to startup, usually
by "pymol.com".
