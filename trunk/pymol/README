PyMOL is an OPEN SOURCE program distributed under the "Python" license.
Please see the LICENSE file for additional information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
See INSTALL for installation instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PyMOL has the following external dependencies:
  1. OpenGL
  2. GLUT library for OpenGL (or freeglut)
  3. Python (v 2.1 or better) compiled with threads support
  4. libpng (can compiled without it, but image saves won't work)
  5. Tcl/Tk (for the external GUI)
  6. Numerical Python (technically optional)
  7. Python megawidgets (Pmw -- only required for the "external" GUI)
  8. FreeType2 (if you want nice fonts)

The PyMOL Team:

NOTE: this list has not been updated since Fall 2003.  Since then, the
PyMOL effort has grown to such an extent that it is no longer
practical to recognize everyone individually.  Fortunately, a public
record of participation exists and can be appreciated on the internet,
and especially via the PyMOL mailing list archives.  Suffice it to say
that the PyMOL user community now numbers well into the thousands and
includes scientists, students, and educators worldwide, spread
throughout academia and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries.  Though DeLano Scientific LLC specifically supports and
maintains the PyMOL code base, the project can only continue to
succeed through the sponsorship and participation of the broader
community.

   Founder and Principal Author:

      Warren L. DeLano 

   Major Authors (5000+ lines of code):

      Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve (SGLite Module)
   
   Minor Authors (500+ lines of code):

      Scott Dixon (Metaphorics CEX support)
      Filipe Maia (Slice Objects)

   Other Contributors: These are the people who have gone out of
      their way to help the project with their ideas, actions, 
      advice, hardware donations, testing, information, sponsorship,
      peer support, or code snippets.
